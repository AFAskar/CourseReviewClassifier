# Course Review Classification Project

In this project, student course reviews stored in a JSON file are analyzed and classified as Good
or Bad.

## Tasks

- [] Load the JSON file that contains the student reviews.

- [] Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  - Count the number of reviews.
  - Check the number of Good and Bad reviews.
  - Analyze the length of the reviews.

- [] Apply text preprocessing:

  - Convert text to lowercase.
  - Remove punctuation and special characters.
  - Remove stopwords.
  - Clean the text data.

- [] Apply tokenization using a pre-trained model.

- [] Train three classifiers to predict whether a course is Good or Bad.

- [] Evaluate each classifier using:

  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

- [] Compare the performance of the three classifiers.
